## Stack Exchange IT Procurement Discussion Board

Stack Exchange is a question and answer website that uses crowd sourcing to build a community around specific topics. The U.S. Digital Service created a proposed topic on Stack Exchange to foster the public discussion of government digital service acquisition. We need to show interest before it will be made into an official site so it is currently in “Area 51” which is the Stack Exchange proposal development site. Help support the community by following and contributing to the discussion!
