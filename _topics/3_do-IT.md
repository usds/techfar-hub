## How to Create A Digital Service Acquisition

Guidance and Discussion are crucial to success in understanding what to implement in the digital service acquisition environment but when having to sit down and do it, the task may seem daunting. This section provides tools, samples, and templates that can help you get started.

### Estimation Tool

It is important to have an estimate that aligns with your agile approach. The [Agile Team Estimator](https://acquisition-planning-beta.herokuapp.com/agile_estimator) can help build an Independent Government Cost Estimate (IGCE) for Agile Development services.

### Requirement Tools

### Sources Sought Tool
Once you have determined what it is you need, you need to know where to get it. The Sources Sought tool is a Google form. If your agency allows you to use Google products, simply make a copy and send it out or post it with your RFI. If you do not have access to Google products you can use the Word version under the template section at the bottom of this page.
