## Resources for Project Teams

### Review Before You Buy

### <a name="fieldGuides"></a>USDS Procurement Field Guides

These Procurement Field Guides are intended to help participants in the government acquisition community with general knowledge, tips, or common practice methods that will help implement digital service strategies. 

These are living documents, not policy or procedure. We encourage crowdsourcing and contribution to these guides as the body of knowledge around this topic increases or becomes more refined. Each guide has a contribution link to our github repository that facilitates this process.
