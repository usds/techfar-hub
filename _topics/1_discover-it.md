## Resources for Project Teams

### Review Before You Buy
Before embarking on an acquisition, review the Digital Services Playbook and TechFAR Handbook to learn best practices. 

- [The Digital Services Playbook:](https://playbook.cio.gov){:target="_blank"} 13 key “plays” drawn from successful practices from the private sector and government that, if followed together, will help government build effective digital services.
- [The TechFAR Handbook:](https://playbook.cio.gov/techFAR){:target="_blank"} Resources on how to use contractors to support an iterative, customer-driven software development process, as is routinely done in the private sector.


### USDS Procurement Field Guides

These Procurement Field Guides are intended to help participants in the government acquisition community with general knowledge, tips and tricks, or common practice methods that will help implement digital service strategies. These are living documents, not policy or procedure. We encourage crowdsourcing and contribution to these guides as the body of knowledge around this topic increases or becomes more refined. Each guide has a contribution link to our github repository that facilitates this process.  

- [Finding Opportunities and Providing Services to the Federal Government:](https://techfarhub.cio.gov/assets/files/ContractorHowToGuide_I_1.pdf){:target="_blank"} Knowing how to start selling digital services to the federal government can be a daunting task for even the most seasoned business owner. This guide is intended to walk through some of the initial processes required in an effort to reduce the time it takes to bring innovative digital service companies into the government marketplace. [Github version](https://github.com/usds/techfar-hub/blob/master/docs/Finding-Opportunities-and-Providing-Services-to-the-Federal-Government-Guide.md)
- [Quick and Dirty Guide to Agile Project Management:](https://techfarhub.cio.gov/assets/files/Quick and Dirty Skinny on Agile Software Development-I2.pdf){:target="_blank"} This summary guide provides information on the key tenants of agile project managment and explains how it can be used to manage digital services projects.
- [Create an Inspiring Product Vision:](https://techfarhub.cio.gov/assets/files/CreateAnInspritingProductVisionF.pdf){:target="_blank"} The product vision is THE true north of a project. It is as the French say, the “raison d’etre” for a project. In other words, it is the reason why the entire project to create a product(s) exists. Without a product vision, there is no direction and little chance of creating a useful working product that serves a useful purpose for the organization.
