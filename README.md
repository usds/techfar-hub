# TechFAR Hub
======================

## Mission
The goal of the site is to help acquisition professionals learn, discuss, and execute Digital Service Acquisitions

## How it works

The site is broken into three functional areas; Discover, Discuss, and Do. The Discover IT page provides tools to learn about DS acquisitions. The Discuss IT page is focused on fostering conversations about lessons learned and how to overcome obstacles. The Do IT page is focused on heping you actually start your acquisition.
