## Digital Service Maturity Determiniation

*Target Users - Contracting Officers and Specialists*

When planning an acquisition strategy for iterative development contracts, such as agile software or human centered design, it is important for the contracting professional to be able to increase the chance of acquisition success through lowering risks. One method of doing this is to understand the organizational maturity of how culturally ready for digital service implementations the “requiring activity” is and develop an acquisition strategy that aligns appropriately.

An organization that has never worked with these kinds of services might find it difficult to jump right to running a complex coding challenge as part of a solicitation, awarding a large IDIQ or BPA, or knowing how to track and measure success of delivery in a way that corresponds to delivering the best business value to the end users. Likewise, a mature digital service government team can define and evaluate solution providers to find the kind of company they want to build a solid team and relationship with vs. just finding a company that can hire to projects well.

This Digital Service Maturity Determination tool is one way to understand how ready the organization is and how to apply that knowledge.

These attributes describe the culture, practices, and behaviors of a model digital service organization. It is important in a solicitation to be able to communicate, not only internally within organization but also externally to offerors, the alignment to these attributes your requiring activity is to ensure that the best acquisition outcomes. 
After you complete this assessment and get your level, reference the Digital Acquisition Strategy Guide for best practices to plan your solicitation.

Note: “Requiring Activity” is the office, program, or agency that is providing the requirements and funding for the purpose of conducting an acquisition.


Instructions
1. For each attribute, read the description and choose the rating that most closely matches the current state of your organization
2. After completing all 9 attributes your score will be totalled
3. Your score will put your organization in one of these three ranges:

   **Novice:** Lack of structure or practice of the attributes, relies on tried and true methods such as waterfall,  management and practitioners are interested in change but not yet executing on adopting the cultural and technical changes necessary (9-18 points)
   
   **Intermediate:** Begins implementing changes to governance and culture to adopt of model attributes as repeatable processes, starting to qualitatively track metrics and apply lessons learned (19-36 points)
   
   **Expert:** Embodies the model attributes, continually refining and optimizing team efforts, proactively building and investing in continuous delivery with end users (37-45 points)
