<p>Government procurement cycles do not keep pace with fast-changing technology and user needs. Waterfall development methods, complex specifications, and inflexible contracts all contribute. We need to adopt and adapt patterns and practices from private industry, which is often able to deliver products faster, cheaper, and at higher quality. In the TechFAR Hub you will be able to learn everything you need to plan and execute a digital service acquisition. You will also find resources to engage with the Acquisition Community to ask questions and share your experiences to help others. Finally, the TechFAR Hub provides powerful tools and templates to get you started on your very own Digital Service Acquisition!</p>
